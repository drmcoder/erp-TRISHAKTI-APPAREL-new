## 🎯 **YOUR GARMENT WORKFLOW - READY FOR DIGITIZATION**

### **✅ Current Manual Process (Understood)**
```
1. Supervisor: Loads "3233#tshirt" into production line

4. Monthly: Supervisor calculates wages and pays staff
```

### **🚀 Target Digital Process (Designed)**
```
1. Management: Enters "8082# Polo T-shirt - 300pcs" 
   → Automatic size/color breakdown (Blue XL: 30pcs, Green 2XL: 28pcs)
   
2. System: Creates bundles with QR codes
   → Blue XL 30pc → Operator A (shoulder join)
   → Green 2XL 28pc → Operator B (side seam)
   
3. Mobile Interface: Operators scan bundles
   → Quick piece completion entry
   → Automatic pricing calculations
   
4. Real-time Dashboard: Live production monitoring
   → Bundle locations → Operator performance → Daily wages
```

### **🔄 Process Flow Support**
```
✅ Sequential Operations: Single Needle → Overlock → Flatlock
✅ Parallel Processing: Collar + Placket simultaneously  
✅ Return Operations: Overlock → Flatlock → Back to Overlock
✅ Quality Control: Damage piece replacement workflow
