firebase login

# Initialize Firebase hosting (if not already done)
firebase init hosting

# Deploy to production
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Option 2: Netlify
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Option 3: Traditional Web Server
```bash
# Serve locally for testing
npx http-server dist -p 8080

# Or upload the dist/ folder to any web server
# (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
```

## 🔧 Production Environment Setup

### 1. Firebase Configuration
Ensure your Firebase project is configured for production:

```javascript
// Check src/config/firebase.ts
// Make sure production Firebase credentials are set
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.production` file:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_production_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_production_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_production_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_production_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_production_app_id
```

### 3. Firebase Collections
The application will automatically create these collections in production:
- `operators` - Operator profiles and status
- `production_bundles` - Bundle information
- `bundle_operations` - Work operations
- `parts_complaints` - Parts replacement requests
- `bundle_tracking` - Bundle tracking data

## 🧪 Testing Production Build Locally

```bash
# Serve the production build locally
npx http-server dist -p 8080

# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

## 📈 Performance Optimizations
