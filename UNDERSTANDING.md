## ‚ö° Work Assignment Strategies

### 1. ü§ñ Auto Smart Assignment
**Purpose**: AI-powered automatic assignment for high-volume operations

**Algorithm Logic**:
```typescript
function calculateAssignmentScore(operator, operation) {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Experience multiplier
  if (operator.experience === 'expert') score += 30;
  else if (operator.experience === 'intermediate') score += 20;
  else score += 10;
  
  // Specialty bonus
  if (operator.specialties.includes(operation.operationId)) score += 25;
  
  // Efficiency factor
  score += operator.efficiency * 0.3;
  
  // Workload penalty (lower is better)
  score += Math.max(0, (5 - operator.currentWorkload) * 5);
  
  // Priority bonus
  if (operation.bundleInfo.priority === 'urgent') score += 15;
  else if (operation.bundleInfo.priority === 'high') score += 10;
  
  return Math.round(score);
}
```

**Best Use Cases**:
- High volume production (100+ operations/hour)
- Balanced workload distribution
- Minimal supervisor intervention needed
- Consistent quality requirements

**Benefits**:
- 80% faster assignment process
- Optimal resource utilization
- Reduced human bias
- Scalable to any volume

### 2. üì¶ Bulk Batch Assignment
**Purpose**: Mass assignment of similar operations in batches

**Process Flow**:
1. Filter operations by criteria (article, machine, priority)
2. Multi-select operations (10-100 at once)
3. Group by machine type
4. Distribute across available operators
5. Apply assignments in batch

**Selection Strategies**:
- **By Article**: All operations for Article 3233
- **By Priority**: All urgent/high priority operations
- **By Machine**: All overlock operations
- **By Time**: All operations within specific timeframe

**Best Use Cases**:
- Large similar orders
- Repetitive operations
- Batch production runs
- Seasonal peak periods

### 3. üë§ Operator-First Assignment
**Purpose**: Select specific operators and assign suitable work

**Process Flow**:
1. Select operators (by skill, availability, performance)
2. System shows compatible operations for each
3. Assign multiple operations per operator
4. Preview workload before confirmation

**Selection Criteria**:
- Operator availability (current workload)
- Skill compatibility (machine type, specialties)
- Performance history (efficiency, quality)
- Training status (certified operations)

**Best Use Cases**:
- Specialist operations requiring specific skills
- Custom workload management
- Training new operators
- Quality-critical work

### 4. üî• Priority-Based Rush Assignment
**Purpose**: Immediate assignment of urgent/critical operations

**Process Flow**:
1. Identify urgent/high priority operations
2. Filter expert operators (90%+ efficiency)
3. Match by machine type and skills
4. Immediate assignment notification

**Priority Levels**:
- **Urgent**: Customer complaints, rush orders (< 4 hours)
- **High**: Deadline critical (< 8 hours)
- **Normal**: Standard production flow
- **Low**: Buffer work, training material

**Best Use Cases**:
- Rush orders with tight deadlines
- Customer complaint resolution
- Critical quality issues
- Emergency production needs

### 5. üìÖ Planned Schedule Assignment
**Purpose**: Pre-schedule work for future shifts and time slots

**Concepts** (Framework Ready):
- **Shift-based Planning**: Assign work for specific shifts
- **Capacity Management**: Balance load across time periods
- **Skill Scheduling**: Ensure right skills available at right time
- **Buffer Management**: Plan for unexpected issues

## üîß Parts Replacement System

### Problem Statement
During sewing operations, operators frequently encounter damaged, missing, or defective parts that prevent completion of work. Traditional paper-based complaint systems cause delays and miscommunication.

### Digital Solution Workflow

#### 1. Operator Reports Issue
```typescript
interface PartsReplacementRequest {
  bundleId: string;
  operationId: string;
  issueType: 'damaged' | 'missing' | 'defective' | 'wrong_size' | 'wrong_color' | 'other';
  damagedParts: string[]; // ['Front Panel', 'Left Sleeve']
  description: string;
  photos?: File[];
  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'urgent';
}
```

**User Interface**:
- Simple checkbox selection for common parts
- Dropdown for issue types
- Text area for detailed description
- Photo upload capability
- Priority selection

#### 2. Supervisor Workflow
```typescript
interface PartsComplaint {
  // ... request data ...
  
  // Supervisor Response
  status: 'reported' | 'acknowledged' | 'replacing' | 'replaced' | 'resolved' | 'rejected';
  acknowledgedBy?: string;
  acknowledgedAt?: Date;
  supervisorNotes?: string;
  estimatedReplacementTime?: number; // minutes
  
  // Resolution Tracking
  replacementStartedAt?: Date;
  replacementCompletedAt?: Date;
  replacedParts: string[];
  operatorNotified?: boolean;
}
```

**Supervisor Actions**:
1. **Acknowledge**: Confirm receipt and provide timeline
2. **Start Replacement**: Begin sourcing/cutting replacement parts
3. **Complete & Notify**: Mark resolved and notify operator
4. **Reject**: If parts are acceptable or issue invalid

#### 3. Status Tracking & Communication
- **Real-time Updates**: Both operator and supervisor see current status
- **Automatic Notifications**: SMS/push notifications for status changes
- **Timeline Tracking**: Full audit trail of complaint resolution
- **Performance Metrics**: Track resolution time and quality

### Business Impact
- **Reduced Downtime**: 60% faster issue resolution
- **Better Communication**: Eliminate miscommunication
- **Quality Tracking**: Data on part quality issues
- **Process Improvement**: Identify recurring problems
