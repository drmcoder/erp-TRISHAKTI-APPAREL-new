## 🎯 **Your Specific Workflow Requirements**

### **Current Manual Process (What You Do Now)**
```
1. Supervisor loads item: "3233#tshirt" into production line
2. Sequential operations through machines:
   - Overlock → Various operations → Different machines
3. Operators manually document:
   - Total pieces received for work
   - Completed pieces + price per station
   - Monthly record accumulation
4. Supervisor calculates total wages monthly and pays staff
```

### **Target Digital Process (What We Need to Build)**
```
1. Management enters: "8082# Polo T-shirt - 300pcs"
   - Automatic size/color breakdown
   - Process sequence definition
   
2. System creates bundles:
   - Blue XL: 30pcs → Operator A (shoulder join)
   - Green 2XL: 28pcs → Operator B (side seam)
   - Real-time bundle tracking
   
3. Operators use mobile interface:
   - Scan bundle QR codes
   - Mark operations complete
   - Automatic pricing calculation
   
4. Real-time dashboard shows:
   - Live production status
   - Operator performance
   - Daily wage calculations
```
