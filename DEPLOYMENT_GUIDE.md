- `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN`: Lighthouse CI token

## ðŸš¦ Deployment Process

### Manual Deployment

#### Staging Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Or with dry run first
npm run deploy:staging:dry-run
npm run deploy:staging
```

#### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production with backup
npm run deploy:production:backup

# Or standard production deployment
npm run deploy:production
```

### Automated Deployment (CI/CD)

The project includes automated deployment via GitHub Actions:

#### Staging (Automatic)
- Triggered on push to `develop` branch
- Runs full test suite
- Deploys to staging environment
- Sends notification to Slack

#### Production (Manual)
- Triggered on push to `main` branch
- Requires manual approval in GitHub
- Runs comprehensive testing
- Creates deployment backup
- Deploys to production
- Creates GitHub release

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Clear build cache
rm -rf dist .vite

# Run build locally to debug
npm run build
```

#### Firebase Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check Firebase login status
firebase login:list

# Re-authenticate if needed
firebase login --reauth

# Verify project selection
firebase use --add
```

#### Environment Variable Issues
```bash
# Verify environment file exists
ls -la .env*

# Check environment variables are loaded
npm run build 2>&1 | grep VITE_
```

### Performance Issues

#### Bundle Size Optimization
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze:bundle

# Check for large dependencies
npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist
```

#### Runtime Performance
```bash
# Run performance analysis
npm run analyze:complexity

# Check Lighthouse scores
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4173 --view
```

### Rollback Procedures

#### Automatic Rollback (CI/CD)
The deployment pipeline includes automatic rollback on failure.

#### Manual Rollback
```bash
# List Firebase hosting releases
firebase hosting:channel:list

# Deploy previous version
firebase hosting:channel:deploy --version=PREVIOUS_VERSION live

# Or use deployment script with backup
./scripts/deploy.sh production --rollback
```
