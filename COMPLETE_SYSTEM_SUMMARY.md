```
1. Management enters: "8082# Polo T-shirt - 300pcs"
   → Size/color breakdown → Process sequence

2. System creates bundles:
   → Blue XL: 30pcs → Operator A (shoulder join)
   → Green 2XL: 28pcs → Operator B (side seam)
   → Real-time tracking

3. Mobile operator interface:
   → QR scan → Mark complete → Auto pricing

4. Real-time dashboard:
   → Live status → Performance → Daily wages
